## How it works|

This circuit implements a four gates, AND, NAND, XOR, and XNOR where each input has one bit.


## How to test|
Simulate using Wokwi,testing against this truth table as a golden file

|  A      | B      |   AND  |  NAND  |  XOR  |  XNOR  |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0       | 0      | 0      | 1      |  0    |  1     |
| 0       | 1      | 0      | 1      |  1    |  0     |
| 1       | 0      | 0      | 1      |  1    |  0     |
| 1       | 1      | 1      | 0      |  0    |  1     |
